This Repository contains my working files of "Conversation Q&A Chatbot with RAG using Langchain Project", an Gen AI Project

(i) Built a conversational Q&A chatbot using LangChain and Groq API

(ii) Used web-based loaders and BeautifulSoup to extract content from websites as external data sources

(iii) Split documents into chunks with recursive character text splitter to manage context size

(iv) Created vector embeddings with Hugging Face embeddings and stored them in Chroma

(v) Built retrievers and history-aware retrievers to fetch relevant info considering chat history

(vi) Developed custom prompt templates and RAG chains for context-aware answers

(vii) Implemented chat history with MessagesPlaceholder to enable multi-turn conversation

(viii) Demonstrated session-based memory to maintain context across multiple user interactions
